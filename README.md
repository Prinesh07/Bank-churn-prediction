## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Bank churn prediction refers to identifying customers who are likely to leave a bank or stop using its services. This project leverages machine learningâ€”specifically a **Random Forest Classifier**â€”to predict churn based on historical customer data.

By analyzing features like **credit score, tenure, balance, number of products, and customer activity**, this model provides insights that can help banks:

- ðŸŽ¯ **Target high-risk customers** with personalized retention campaigns  
- ðŸ“‰ **Reduce churn rate** and improve customer loyalty  
- ðŸ’° **Optimize marketing costs** by focusing on the right segment  
- ðŸ“Š **Understand feature importance**, helping banks adjust policies or offerings

### ðŸ§° Whatâ€™s Included

- âœ… Cleaned and preprocessed dataset  
- âœ… Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations  
- âœ… Model training using Random Forest  
- âœ… Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  
- âœ… Feature importance and confusion matrix visualizations  
- âœ… Well-structured Jupyter Notebook for reproducibility  

This solution is ideal for data science portfolios, training models in customer analytics, or as a foundation for production-grade churn prediction systems.
